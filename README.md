# Load-Cell-Sensors
Suppose you are an analyst for a company that makes sensors.  Your company is working on a new Load Cell Sensor and wants to test its reliability with several different tests.  Reliability specialists often describe the lifetime of a population of these types of products using a graphical representation called the bathtub curve. The bathtub curve consists of three periods: an infant mortality period with a decreasing failure rate followed by a normal life period (also known as "useful life") with a low, relatively constant failure rate and concluding with a wear-out period that exhibits an increasing failure rate.
